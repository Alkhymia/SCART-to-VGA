# SCART to VGA
Adapt SCART to VGA (RGBS) with optional sync stripper. You can either include all the parts and select on and off with a jumper (i.e. https://www.arrow.com/en/products/msc-g/adam-tech) or leave the sync stripper circuit off entirely and just connect side of the 2.54mm pins by "Bypass" together.
